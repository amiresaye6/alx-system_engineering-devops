## What is a Server?

A server is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or functionality to other computers, known as clients, over a network. It can serve various purposes, including hosting websites, managing databases, or providing access to files.

Explanation: Provide a brief overview of server functionality and its role in computing.

---

## Server Locations

Servers can physically exist in various locations. They might be housed in data centers, company premises, or cloud infrastructure provided by services like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.

Explanation: Detail where servers are typically located and mention different hosting environments.

---

## SSH (Secure Shell)

SSH, or Secure Shell, is a cryptographic network protocol that provides a secure way to access and manage remote devices or servers over an unsecured network. It allows secure data communication, remote command-line login, remote command execution, and other network services.

Explanation: Describe what SSH is and its primary functionalities in secure communication and remote access.

## Creating an SSH RSA Key Pair

An SSH key pair consists of a public and private key. To create an RSA key pair:

1. Open the terminal.
2. Use the `ssh-keygen` command with the `-t rsa` flag to generate the key pair.
3. Follow the prompts to specify the file location and optionally, set a passphrase.

Example:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
