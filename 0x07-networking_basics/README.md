# OSI Model

- **What it is:** The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a conceptual framework used to understand and standardize the functions of a telecommunication or computing system.

- **How many layers it has:** The OSI Model consists of seven layers.

- **How it is organized:**
  1. Application Layer
  2. Presentation Layer
  3. Session Layer
  4. Transport Layer
  5. Network Layer
  6. Data Link Layer
  7. Physical Layer

- **What is a LAN:**
  - A LAN (Local Area Network) is a network of interconnected devices within a limited area, such as a home, office, or building.

- **Typical usage:**
  - LANs are used for sharing resources, like files, printers, and internet connections, among devices in a localized environment.

- **Typical geographical size:**
  - Usually covers a small physical area, like a single building or a group of nearby buildings.

- **What is a WAN:**
  - A WAN (Wide Area Network) is a network that covers a broad area, like a city, country, or even multiple countries.

- **Typical usage:**
  - WANs are used for connecting LANs over long distances, allowing communication between geographically separated networks.

- **Typical geographical size:**
  - Spans across large geographical areas, potentially covering a city, region, or even global distances.

- **What is the Internet:**
  - The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers and servers that communicate using a common set of protocols.

- **What is an IP address:**
  - An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique numerical identifier assigned to each device on a network to facilitate communication.

- **What are the 2 types of IP address:**
  - IPv4 (32-bit) and IPv6 (128-bit) addresses.

- **What is localhost:**
  - "localhost" refers to the loopback address (127.0.0.1), which allows a device to communicate with itself.

- **What is a subnet:**
  - A subnet is a division of an IP network into smaller, more manageable segments.

- **Why IPv6 was created:**
  - IPv6 was created to address the limited address space of IPv4 and provide a larger pool of unique addresses for devices on the internet.

- **TCP/UDP:**
  - TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are transport layer protocols used for data transmission over IP networks.

- **What are the 2 mainly used data transfer protocols for IP (transfer level on the OSI schema):**
  - TCP and UDP.

- **What is the main difference between TCP and UDP:**
  - TCP provides reliable, connection-oriented communication, while UDP offers faster, connectionless communication without error-checking.

- **What is a port:**
  - A port is a logical endpoint for communication, allowing different services or applications to use the same IP address.

- **Memorize SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS port numbers:**
  - - SSH: 22
    - HTTP: 80
    - HTTPS: 443

- **What tool/protocol is often used to check if a device is connected to a network:**
  - ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is often used for network diagnostics, including tools like ping.
