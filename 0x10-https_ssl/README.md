# Understanding HTTPS and SSL/TLS

HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) is an extension of HTTP that ensures secure communication over a computer network. It relies on SSL/TLS protocols for encryption, offering a secure channel between a client and server.

## Roles of HTTPS/SSL

1. **Encryption:**
   HTTPS employs SSL/TLS to encrypt data transmitted between a client and a server, preventing unauthorized access or eavesdropping.

2. **Authentication:**
   SSL/TLS certificates verify the identity of websites, ensuring users connect to legitimate servers, mitigating the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks.

## Purpose of Encrypting Traffic

Encrypting traffic using SSL/TLS serves several crucial purposes:

- **Data Confidentiality:**
  It secures sensitive information, making it unreadable to unauthorized parties.

- **Data Integrity:**
  It ensures data remains unchanged during transmission, preventing tampering.

- **Authentication:**
  SSL/TLS certificates validate the identity of servers, establishing trust between users and websites.

## SSL Termination

SSL termination refers to the process of decrypting encrypted traffic at a proxy or load balancer before forwarding it to the destination server. It allows the proxy to inspect, filter, or modify the traffic before reaching the server.

### Example Scenario:

Consider a scenario involving SSL termination:
+-----------+    +--------------+   +--------------+
|  Client   | -> | Load Balancer| ->|  Web Server  |
+-----------+    +--------------+   +--------------+
   Encrypted        Decrypt &      Unencrypted
   Traffic          Inspect        Traffic

In this scenario, the load balancer terminates SSL, inspects the traffic, and forwards it unencrypted to the web server.

SSL termination enables implementing security features, like content filtering or traffic monitoring, without burdening the web server with decryption tasks.
