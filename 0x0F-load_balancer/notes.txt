this file is my notes about the consept of load balancing:
frontend is every thign from the client until the proxy.
backend is every thing from the proxy until the database.
to open any of alx servers use this command
>> ssh -i ~/.ssh/school ubuntu@IP_address

to install HAProxy

Connect to my server through SSH
>> ssh -i ~/.ssh/school ubuntu@100.25.204.148

Check the version of Ubuntu that was running on my server
>> lsb_release -a

Get the specific HAProxy package for your version of Ubuntu

Instructions for the latest release
You need to enable a dedicated PPA with the following command:

>> apt-get install --no-install-recommends software-properties-common
>> add-apt-repository ppa:vbernat/haproxy-2.8

Then, use the following command:

>> apt-get install haproxy=2.8.\*
You will get the latest release of HAProxy 2.8 (and stick to this branch).

Configure HAProxy to share requests between two servers

we will need to make this config file:

frontend  amir-frontend
        bind *:80
        mode http
        default_backend amir-backend
backend amir-backend
        balance roundrobin
        server 336631-web-01 100.25.204.148:80 check
        server 336631-web-02 54.210.1.39:80 check

use this command
>> sudo vim /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
and this to make a backub
>>sudo cp -a /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg{,.original_copy}

enable HAProxy to be started by the init script.
>> echo "ENABLED=1" | sudo tee -a /etc/default/haproxy
Restart HAProxy
>> sudo service haproxy restart
