# Monitoring README

## Overview
This README provides essential information regarding monitoring for a web server, focusing on the necessity of monitoring, the main areas to monitor, and the significance of access and error logs for a web server like Nginx.

## Why is Monitoring Needed?
Monitoring is essential for maintaining the health, performance, and security of a web server environment. It allows proactive identification of issues, ensures optimal performance, helps in capacity planning, and aids in detecting and mitigating security threats.

## Main Areas of Monitoring
1. **Performance Monitoring**: Tracking server resource utilization such as CPU, memory, disk usage, and network bandwidth to ensure optimal performance and identify potential bottlenecks.
   
2. **Availability and Uptime Monitoring**: Monitoring the availability and uptime of the web server to ensure uninterrupted service delivery and promptly address any downtime incidents.

## Access Logs for a Web Server (e.g., Nginx)
Access logs record detailed information about every request made to the web server, including the source IP address, requested URL, response status code, user-agent, and timestamp. These logs are valuable for analyzing traffic patterns, identifying popular content, troubleshooting issues, and detecting potential security threats such as unauthorized access attempts or denial-of-service attacks.

## Error Logs for a Web Server (e.g., Nginx)
Error logs capture information about server errors encountered during request processing, such as HTTP errors (e.g., 404 Not Found), server-side errors (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error), and other application-specific errors. Analyzing error logs helps in diagnosing and resolving issues, identifying misconfigurations, debugging application errors, and improving the overall reliability and stability of the web server.
